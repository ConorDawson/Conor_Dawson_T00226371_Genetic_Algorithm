A Timetable problem solved using the Genetic Algorithm 

The task is to design a timetable for a college course, where subjects, classrooms, and lecturers are assigned to timeslots, ensuring there are no conflicts with the room schedule, teacher schedule, or subject schedule. The goal is to maximize the efficiency and accuracy of the scheduling process, adhering to the constraints such as:

No Room Conflicts: A classroom can only be assigned to one subject at any given time.
No Lecturer Conflicts: A lecturer can only teach one subject at a time.
No Subject Conflicts: A subject should be assigned to only one timeslot for each day.
Breaks times being an hour break from 1 to 2
Half days on friday to fit with the colleges schedule.
These constraints are important because they ensure that the schedule works without clashes, allowing efficient use of resources (rooms and lecturers) and providing students with a smooth educational experience.
